Another entry to my list of spaceship-related games.  
I wanted to make a more bullet hell oriented game here (in the most recent demo build uploaded to here I just gave the enemy a bunch of random weapons).

This was actually written in PICO-8 originally but I ended up using about half the cart's tokens at the point where I first started implementing enemies so I just moved to GameMaker.
